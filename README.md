# Redis TimeSeries Adapter
Redis TimeSeries Adapter receives [Prometheus][prometheus] metrics via the 
[remote write][prometheus_remote_write], 
and writes to [Redis with TimeSeries module][redis_time_series].

## Getting Started
to build the project:
```bash
make build
cd bin
```

To send metrics to Redis, provide address in host:port format. 
```bash
redis-ts-adapter --redis-address localhost:6379
```

To receive metrics from Prometheus, Add [remote write][prometheus_remote_write_config] 
section to prometheus configuration:
```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9201/write'
```  

## Makefile commands
run tests:
```bash
make test
```
go linting:
```bash
make lint
```
### Redis Sentinel
If you have Redis Sentinel set up for high availability redis, use the `redis-sentinel` flags:
```bash
redis-ts-adapter --redis-sentinel-address localhost:26379 --redis-sentinel-master mydb
```

## Additional flags

Print help:
```bash
redis-ts-adapter --help
```

Set log level:
```bash
redis-ts-adapter --log.level debug
```

Set the timeout to use when sending samples to the remote storage:
```bash
redis-ts-adapter --send-timeout 60s
```
Set the listening port for prometheus to send metrics: 
```bash
redis-ts-adapter --web.listen-address 127.0.0.1:9201
```
